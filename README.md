# SMRTTECH 4AI3 Project Fall 2023 - Project 3: Loan Prediction
This repository is for the SMRTTECH 4AI3 Project Fall 2023. The group conducting this project was Group 5, and choose to complete Project 3: Loan Prediction.

## Overview
This project aims to address the challenges faced by the banking sector in assessing a loan requests from a client and managing the risks associated with it. By leveraging some machine learning techniques learned in class, we seek to predict the loan status of a client based on several different criterias.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains a variety of information pretaining to the client, and it serves as the foundation for training and evaluating machine learning models. The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset

## Project Objectives
#### Data Visualization and Preprocessing:
- Explore and visualize the dataset to gain insights into the contents of various features.
- Handle any missing values and provide any data preprocessing steps necessary for model training.

#### Feature Selection:
- Evaluate and select the top features that contribute to the prediction of loan credibility.

#### Algorithm Exploration:
- Explore a number of machine learning algorithms suitable for this binary classification task.
- Compare the performance of different models and identify the best one to predict the loan.

#### Model Training:
- Train a machine learning model using the selected features and algorithm on a new dataset, to predict a loan credibility for a variety of clients.

## Results
The results of the project can be found in the final report file submitted with this upload. Please refer to it for any documentation of the contents of the code.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project has provided insightful tools to help us excel in building machine learning models. Any information regarding certain aspects of the file, and how the code was approached, can be found in the final report submission.
